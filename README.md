# JavaFX Scientific Calculator

This project is a **Graphical Scientific Calculator** application developed using **JavaFX**, created as the **final project for the DISM (Diploma in Software Engineering) diploma** at **Aptech Computer Education**.

## üîç Overview

The calculator supports a comprehensive set of mathematical, scientific, and logic-based operations, presented in a clean and interactive graphical user interface. It was designed to reinforce programming fundamentals, GUI design principles using Java and JavaFX.

## üéØ Features

- **Basic arithmetic**: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
- **Scientific functions**:
  - Exponentiation, Square, Cube, Square Root, Cube Root
  - Trigonometric: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan
  - Logarithmic: log, ln, exp
  - Approximation: round, floor, ceil
- **Statistical operations**: average, min, max
- **Number theory tools**:
  - GCD (Greatest Common Divisor), LCM (Least Common Multiple)
  - Prime number checker
  - Armstrong number checker
  - Palindrome checker
- **GUI options**:
  - Light and Dark themes
  - Expandable advanced panel
  - Keyboard input support

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Java SE**
- **JavaFX for GUI**
- Custom CSS (Light and Dark themes)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

- **Java JDK with JavaFX support** (recommended: [Liberica Full JDK](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/))

### Running the App

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedsalah-tech/JavaFX-Calculator-Application.git
   cd JavaFX-Calculator-Application

   ```

2. Run the `.jar` file from the `Compiled Code` folder:

   - Simply **double-click** the `.jar` file to launch the calculator.
   - Make sure you have **Java JDK installed** (preferably one that includes JavaFX support, like [Liberica Full JDK](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/)).

   If double-clicking doesn't work, you can run it manually via terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   java -jar Calculator.jar
   ```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Notes

- Built without FXML ‚Äì all UI elements are constructed programmatically for clarity and control.
- Code is modular, commented, and structured to allow easy maintenance or extension.
- The UI dynamically adapts with a toggleable advanced panel and theme switching (light/dark mode).
- Input validation and exception handling ensure smooth user experience and error handling.
- All logic, including evaluation of complex expressions and custom functions (e.g., GCD, Prime check, Armstrong), is implemented in pure Java.

## üì∏ Screenshots

Screenshots of the application, including both **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode** interfaces, as well as scientific and number theory features, are provided in the **"Screenshots" section of the official project report document**.
